# cook

The primary orchestrator for feature implementation. Coordinates the entire L2 mesh in a phased TDD workflow.

<HARD-GATE>
Before starting ANY implementation:
1. You MUST understand the codebase first (Phase 1)
2. You MUST have a plan before writing code (Phase 2)
3. You MUST write failing tests before implementation (Phase 3) — unless explicitly skipped
This applies to EVERY feature regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase Skip Rules

Not every task needs every phase:

```
Simple bug fix:      Phase 1 → 4 → 6 → 7
Small refactor:      Phase 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7
New feature:         Phase 1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
Complex feature:     All phases + brainstorm in Phase 2
Security-sensitive:  All phases + sentinel escalated to opus
Fast mode:           Phase 1 → 4 → 6 → 7 (auto-detected, see below)
```

Determine complexity BEFORE starting. Create TodoWrite with applicable phases.

## Fast Mode (Auto-Detect)

Cook auto-detects small changes and streamlines the pipeline:

```
IF all of these are true:
  - Total estimated change < 30 LOC
  - Single file affected
  - No security-relevant code (auth, crypto, payments, .env)
  - No public API changes
  - No database schema changes
THEN: Fast Mode activated
  - Skip Phase 2 (PLAN) — change is too small for a formal plan
  - Skip Phase 3 (TEST) — unless existing tests cover the area
  - Skip Phase 5b (SENTINEL) — non-security code
  - Skip Phase 8 (BRIDGE) — not worth persisting
  - KEEP Phase 5a (PREFLIGHT) and Phase 6 (VERIFY) — always run quality checks
```

**Announce fast mode**: "Fast mode: small change detected (<30 LOC, single file, non-security). Streamlined pipeline."
**Override**: User can say "full pipeline" to force all phases even on small changes.

## Phase 1: UNDERSTAND

**Goal**: Know what exists before changing anything.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:scout`

1. Create TodoWrite with all applicable phases for this task
2. Mark Phase 1 as `in_progress`
3. Invoke scout to scan the codebase:
   - Use `Glob` to find files matching the feature domain (e.g., `**/*auth*`, `**/*user*`)
   - Use `Grep` to search for related patterns, imports, existing implementations
   - Use `Read` to examine key files identified
4. Summarize findings:
   - What exists already
   - What patterns/conventions the project uses
   - What files will likely need to change
5. **Python async detection**: If Python project detected (`pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`), use `Grep` for async indicators:
   - Search for: `async def`, `await`, `aiosqlite`, `aiohttp`, `httpx.AsyncClient`, `asyncio.run`, `trio`
   - If ≥3 matches across source files → flag project as **"async-first Python"**
   - Note for later phases: new code should default to `async def`, avoid blocking calls (`requests.get`, `time.sleep`, `open()`)
6. Mark Phase 1 as `completed`

**Gate**: If scout finds the feature already exists → STOP and inform user.

## Phase 1.5: DOMAIN CONTEXT (L4 Pack Detection)

**Goal**: Detect if domain-specific L4 extension packs apply to this task.

After scout completes (Phase 1), check if the detected tech stack or task description matches any L4 extension pack. If a match is found, read the pack's PACK.md to load domain-specific patterns, constraints, and sharp edges into the current workflow.

1. Check the project's detected stack against the L4 pack mapping:

| Signal in Codebase or Task | Pack | File |
|---|---|---|
| `*.tsx`, `*.svelte`, `*.vue`, Tailwind, CSS modules | `@rune/ui` | `extensions/ui/PACK.md` |
| Express/Fastify/NestJS routes, API endpoints | `@rune/backend` | `extensions/backend/PACK.md` |
| Dockerfile, `.github/workflows/`, Terraform | `@rune/devops` | `extensions/devops/PACK.md` |
| `react-native`, `expo`, `flutter`, `ios/`, `android/` | `@rune/mobile` | `extensions/mobile/PACK.md` |
| Auth, OWASP, secrets, PCI/HIPAA markers | `@rune/security` | `extensions/security/PACK.md` |
| Trading, charts, market data, `decimal.js` | `@rune/trading` | `extensions/trading/PACK.md` |
| Multi-tenant, billing, `stripe`, subscription | `@rune/saas` | `extensions/saas/PACK.md` |
| Cart, checkout, inventory, Shopify | `@rune/ecommerce` | `extensions/ecommerce/PACK.md` |
| `openai`, `anthropic`, embeddings, RAG, LLM | `@rune/ai-ml` | `extensions/ai-ml/PACK.md` |
| `three`, `pixi`, `phaser`, `*.glsl`, game loop | `@rune/gamedev` | `extensions/gamedev/PACK.md` |
| CMS, blog, MDX, `i18next`, SEO | `@rune/content` | `extensions/content/PACK.md` |
| Analytics, tracking, A/B test, funnel | `@rune/analytics` | `extensions/analytics/PACK.md` |

2. If ≥1 pack matches:
   - Use `Read` to load the matching PACK.md
   - Extract the relevant skill's **Workflow** steps and **Constraints**
   - Apply pack constraints alongside cook's own constraints for the rest of the workflow
   - Announce: "Loaded @rune/[pack] — applying [skill-name] domain patterns"

3. If 0 packs match: skip silently, proceed to Phase 2

This phase is lightweight — a Read + pattern match, not a full scan. It does NOT replace Phase 1 (scout) or Phase 2 (plan). It augments them with domain expertise.

## Phase 2: PLAN

**Goal**: Break the task into concrete implementation steps before writing code.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:plan`

1. Mark Phase 2 as `in_progress`
2. Based on scout findings, create an implementation plan:
   - List exact files to create/modify
   - Define the order of changes
   - Identify dependencies between steps
3. If multiple valid approaches exist → invoke `rune:brainstorm` for trade-off analysis
4. Present plan to user for approval
5. Mark Phase 2 as `completed`

**Gate**: User MUST approve the plan before proceeding. Do NOT skip this.

## Phase 3: TEST (TDD Red)

**Goal**: Define expected behavior with failing tests BEFORE writing implementation.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:test`

1. Mark Phase 3 as `in_progress`
2. Write test files based on the plan:
   - Use `Write` to create test files
   - Cover the primary use case + edge cases
   - Tests MUST be runnable
3. **Python async pre-check** (if async-first Python flagged in Phase 1):
   - Verify `pytest-asyncio` is in project dependencies (`pyproject.toml` or `requirements*.txt`)
   - Check `pyproject.toml` for `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` → `asyncio_mode = "auto"` — if missing, warn user and suggest adding it before writing async tests
   - If pytest-asyncio not installed: warn that async tests will silently pass without executing async code
4. Run the tests to verify they FAIL:
   - Use `Bash` to execute the test command (e.g., `pytest`, `npm test`, `cargo test`)
   - Expected: tests FAIL (red) because implementation doesn't exist yet
4. Mark Phase 3 as `completed`

**Gate**: Tests MUST exist and MUST fail. If tests pass without implementation → tests are wrong, rewrite them.

## Phase 4: IMPLEMENT (TDD Green)

**Goal**: Write the minimum code to make tests pass.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:fix`

1. Mark Phase 4 as `in_progress`
2. Implement the feature following the plan:
   - Use `Write` for new files
   - Use `Edit` for modifying existing files
   - Follow project conventions found in Phase 1
3. Run tests after each significant change:
   - Use `Bash` to run tests
   - If tests pass → continue to next step in plan
   - If tests fail → debug and fix
   - **Python async checklist** (if async-first Python flagged in Phase 1):
     - No blocking calls in async functions: `time.sleep()` → `asyncio.sleep()`, `open()` → `aiofiles.open()`, `requests.get()` → `httpx.AsyncClient.get()`
     - Use `async with` for async context managers (DB connections, HTTP sessions)
     - Prefer `asyncio.gather()` for parallel I/O operations
     - Use `asyncio.TaskGroup` (Python 3.11+) for structured concurrency
4. If stuck on unexpected errors → invoke `rune:debug` (max 3 debug↔fix loops)
5. All tests MUST pass before proceeding
6. Mark Phase 4 as `completed`

**Gate**: ALL tests from Phase 3 MUST pass. Do NOT proceed with failing tests.

## Phase 5: QUALITY (Parallel)

**Goal**: Catch issues before they reach production.

Run quality checks **in parallel** for speed. Any CRITICAL finding blocks the commit.

```
PARALLEL EXECUTION:
  Launch 5a + 5b + 5c simultaneously as independent Task agents.
  Wait for ALL to complete before proceeding.
  If any returns BLOCK → fix findings, re-run the blocking check only.
```

### 5a. Preflight (Spec Compliance + Logic)
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:preflight`
- **Spec compliance**: Compare approved plan (Phase 2) vs actual diff — did we build what we planned?
- Logic review: Are there obvious bugs?
- Error handling: Are errors caught properly?
- Completeness: Does it cover edge cases?

### 5b. Security
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:sentinel`
- Secret scan: No hardcoded keys/tokens
- OWASP check: No injection, XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities
- Dependency audit: No known vulnerable packages

### 5c. Code Review
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:review`
- Pattern compliance: Follows project conventions
- Code quality: Clean, readable, maintainable
- Performance: No obvious bottlenecks

### 5d. Completion Gate
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:completion-gate`
- Validate that agent claims match evidence trail
- Check: tests actually ran (stdout captured), files actually changed (git diff), build actually passed
- Any UNCONFIRMED claim → BLOCK with specific gap identified

**Gate**: If sentinel finds CRITICAL security issue → STOP, fix it, re-run. Non-negotiable.
**Gate**: If completion-gate finds UNCONFIRMED claim → STOP, re-verify. Non-negotiable.

## Checkpoint Protocol (Opt-In)

For long-running cook sessions, save intermediate state at phase boundaries:

```
After Phase 2 (PLAN approved):    session-bridge saves plan + decisions
After Phase 4 (IMPLEMENT done):   session-bridge saves progress + modified files
After Phase 5 (QUALITY passed):   session-bridge saves quality results

Trigger: Invoke rune:session-bridge at each boundary.
This is OPT-IN — only activate if:
  - Task spans 3+ phases
  - Context-watch has triggered a warning
  - User explicitly requests checkpoints
```

## Phase 6: VERIFY

**Goal**: Final automated verification before commit.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:verification`

1. Mark Phase 6 as `in_progress`
2. Run full verification suite:
   - Lint check (e.g., `eslint`, `ruff`, `clippy`)
   - Type check (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`, `cargo check`)
   - Full test suite (not just new tests)
   - Build (e.g., `npm run build`, `cargo build`)
3. Use `rune:hallucination-guard` to verify:
   - All imports reference real modules
   - API calls use correct signatures
   - No phantom dependencies
4. Mark Phase 6 as `completed`

**Gate**: ALL checks MUST pass. If any fail → fix and re-run. Do NOT commit broken code.

## Phase 7: COMMIT

**Goal**: Create a clean, semantic commit.

1. Mark Phase 7 as `in_progress`
2. Stage changed files:
   - Use `Bash` to run `git add <specific files>` (NOT `git add .`)
   - Verify staged files with `git status`
3. Create commit with semantic message:
   - Format: `<type>: <description>`
   - Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore
   - Use `Bash` to run `git commit -m "<message>"`
4. Mark Phase 7 as `completed`

## Phase 8: BRIDGE

**Goal**: Save context for future sessions and record metrics for mesh analytics.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL**: Use `rune:session-bridge`

1. Mark Phase 8 as `in_progress`
2. Save decisions to `.rune/decisions.md`:
   - What approach was chosen and why
   - Any trade-offs made
3. Update `.rune/progress.md` with completed task
4. Update `.rune/conventions.md` if new patterns were established
5. **Write skill-sourced metrics** to `.rune/metrics/skills.json`:
   - Read the existing file (or create `{ "version": 1, "updated": "<now>", "skills": {} }`)
   - Under the `cook` key, update:
     - `phases`: increment `run` or `skip` count for each phase that was run/skipped this session
     - `quality_gate_results`: increment `preflight_pass`/`preflight_fail`, `sentinel_pass`/`sentinel_block`, `review_pass`/`review_issues` based on Phase 5 outcomes
     - `debug_loops`: increment `total` by number of debug-fix loops in Phase 4, update `max_per_session` if this session exceeded it
   - Write the updated file back
6. **Adaptive error recovery** (H3 Intelligence):
   - If Phase 4 had 3 debug-fix loops (max) for a specific error pattern, write a routing override to `.rune/metrics/routing-overrides.json`:
     - Format: `{ "id": "r-<timestamp>", "condition": "<error pattern>", "action": "route to problem-solver before debug", "source": "auto", "active": true }`
   - Max 10 active rules — if exceeded, remove oldest inactive rule
7. Mark Phase 8 as `completed`

## Error Recovery

| Phase | If this fails... | Do this... |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 UNDERSTAND | scout finds nothing relevant | Proceed with plan, note limited context |
| 2 PLAN | Task too complex | Break into smaller tasks, consider `rune:team` |
| 3 TEST | Can't write tests (no test framework) | Skip TDD, write tests after implementation |
| 4 IMPLEMENT | Fix hits repeated bugs | `rune:debug` (max 3 loops), then escalate to user |
| 5a PREFLIGHT | Logic issues found | Fix → re-run preflight |
| 5b SENTINEL | Security CRITICAL found | Fix immediately → re-run (mandatory) |
| 5c REVIEW | Code quality issues | Fix CRITICAL/HIGH → re-review (max 2 loops) |
| 6 VERIFY | Build/lint/type fails | Fix → re-run verification |

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Skipping scout to "save time" on a simple task | CRITICAL | Scout Gate blocks this — Phase 1 is mandatory regardless of perceived simplicity |
| Writing code without user-approved plan | HIGH | Plan Gate: do NOT proceed to Phase 3 without explicit approval ("go", "proceed", "yes") |
| Claiming "all tests pass" without showing output | HIGH | Constraint 7 blocks this — show actual test runner output via completion-gate |
| Entering debug↔fix loop more than 3 times without escalating | MEDIUM | After 3 loops, stop and present to user — do not keep spinning |
| Not escalating to sentinel:opus on security-sensitive tasks | MEDIUM | Auth, crypto, payment code → sentinel must run at opus, not sonnet |
| Running Phase 5 checks sequentially instead of parallel | MEDIUM | Launch preflight+sentinel+review as parallel Task agents for speed |
| Saying "done" without evidence trail | CRITICAL | completion-gate validates claims — UNCONFIRMED = BLOCK |
| Fast mode on security-relevant code | HIGH | Fast mode auto-excludes auth/crypto/payments — never fast-track security code |

## Done When

- All applicable phases complete per Phase Skip Rules (determined before starting)
- User has approved the plan (Phase 2 gate — explicit "go" received)
- All tests PASS — actual test runner output shown
- preflight + sentinel + review all PASS or findings addressed
- verification (lint + types + build) green
- Commit created with semantic message
- Cook Report emitted with commit hash and phase list
- Session state saved to .rune/ via session-bridge

## Cost Profile

~$0.05-0.15 per feature. Haiku for scanning (Phase 1), sonnet for coding (Phase 3-4), opus for complex planning (Phase 2 when needed).
